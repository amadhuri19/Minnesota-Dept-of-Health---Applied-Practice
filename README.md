COVID-19 Vaccination Disparities in Minnesota Households with Recently Infected Infants

Introduction.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical role social determinants play in health outcomes, particularly vaccine uptake. This project explores how household COVID-19 vaccination status varies among families with recently infected infants in Minnesota, focusing on race/ethnicity, parental education, and family income. Understanding these disparities can help shape targeted public health interventions to improve vaccination rates and promote health equity.

Research Objectives.
To analyze differences in COVID-19 vaccination rates among households with recently infected infants in Minnesota.
To examine how vaccination rates are influenced by race/ethnicity, parental education, and family income.
To provide actionable insights to inform public health strategies by identifying barriers to vaccine access and acceptance.

Dataset Overview.
Source: Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), COVID-19 Infant Case Project.
Participants: 1,549 households with infants who had recent COVID-19 infections.
Data Collection Period: April 16, 2023 – May 11, 2024.
Key Variables:
Outcome Variables:
Adult Vaccine Status (Vaccinated: 1 = Yes, 0 = No, 3 = Unknown).
6-Month Adult Vaccine Status (Vaccinated within 6 months: 1 = Yes, 0 = No).
Demographic Variables:
Race/Ethnicity: Categories include American Indian, Asian, Black/African American, Hispanic, Multiracial/Other, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, White.
Parental Education: Ranges from "Never attended school" to "Advanced degree."
Family Income: Categories include Less than $30,000, $30,000–$80,000, and Over $80,000.

Methods.
Software: SAS Studio, Release 3.81 (Enterprise Edition).
Analysis: Descriptive statistics and comparison of vaccination status across demographic groups.

Key Results.
Race/Ethnicity:
Asian households had the highest vaccination rate (94.4%), followed by Black/African American (84.3%), Hispanic (82.5%), and Multiracial/Other (83.4%).
Vaccination rates for recent doses (within 6 months) were highest in Asian households (38.9%).
Parental Education:
Households with advanced degrees had the highest vaccination rates (96.3%), followed by college graduates (85.8%).
Vaccination within 6 months was highest in households with advanced degrees (43.9%).
Family Income:
Households earning over $80,000 had the highest vaccination rates (90.3%).
Recent vaccination rates were highest among higher-income households (32.0% for those earning over $80,000).

Discussion.
Race/Ethnicity: Contrary to broader national trends, vaccination rates in Black and Hispanic populations in Minnesota were relatively high, likely due to initiatives such as the COVID-19 Community Coordinators (CCC), which utilized culturally sensitive outreach and addressed vaccine access barriers.
Parental Education: Higher educational attainment was strongly associated with increased vaccine uptake, supporting the broader literature on the relationship between education and vaccine acceptance.
Family Income: While Minnesota’s free vaccine provision helped reduce barriers, lower-income households still faced challenges such as transportation, work hours, and healthcare access.

Strengths and Limitations.
Strengths:
Recent data reflecting current vaccination trends.
Focus on multiple demographic factors for a nuanced understanding.
Limitations:
Self-reported vaccination data may introduce bias.
Results are based on adult vaccination status and may not fully reflect the dynamics for different age groups.
Unmeasured factors, such as cultural beliefs and local policies, might influence the findings.

Conclusion.
The analysis highlights significant disparities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake, with race, education, and income playing pivotal roles. Despite these disparities, Minnesota's community-focused vaccination initiatives, such as the CCC program, have been effective in bridging gaps in vaccine access and acceptance. Future research should explore rural-urban differences and examine how the politicization of vaccines may have influenced vaccine uptake. Continued focus on equity and targeted outreach will be essential in ensuring broader vaccination coverage in the state.
